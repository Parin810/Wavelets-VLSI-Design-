This is a Nios II based ROM component.

1. The ROM contains 63 samples of a one cycle of sinewave generated using Matlab. The matlab script is included in the folder.
2. The Nios II CPU reads each sample by placing the address (0 to 62) and reading the value at that address. The CPU then places
each sample on the Parallel I/O port.
3. The parallel I/O port is connected to DAC 0808.
4. The working demo of this project was shown to TA and Friday batch students.
